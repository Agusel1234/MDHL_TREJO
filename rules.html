            the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these 
            minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will 
            assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
            whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
            from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
